# ❌ Sent Mail Tracker and Automated Follow-up (Excel VBA)

### 📋 Overview
This project aimed to automate tracking of sent candidate emails in Outlook by searching the “Sent Items” folder of a shared mailbox.  
It was designed to detect previously sent emails based on candidate IDs or subjects and send automated follow-up messages.

---

### ⚙️ Objective
- Search a **specific mailbox’s Sent Items** for candidate-related emails.  
- Automatically send follow-up emails if matches were found.  
- Generate a timestamped **Excel log** showing sent and missing records.

---

### ❌ Status
**Dropped** – The project was discontinued due to Outlook restrictions and shared mailbox access limitations within the corporate environment.  
While the automation and logging logic worked correctly, accessing non-default Sent Items folders proved unreliable.

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways
- Improved understanding of Outlook’s folder structure and Namespace object.  
- Learned about permission dependencies when automating shared mailboxes.

---

### 🧠 What Worked
- Candidate-based loop logic.  
- Excel log creation and status tracking.  
- Conditional follow-up email generation.

---

### ⚠️ What Didn’t Work
- Consistent access to **Sent Items** in a shared Outlook mailbox (due to environment and permission constraints).
